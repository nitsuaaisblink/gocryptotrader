NAME
    darwin-debug -- posix spawn a process that is stopped at the entry point
                    for debugging.

SYNOPSIS
    darwin-debug --unix-socket=<SOCKET> [--arch=<ARCH>] [--working-dir=<PATH>] [--disable-aslr] [--no-env] [--setsid] [--help] -- <PROGRAM> [<PROGRAM-ARG> <PROGRAM-ARG> ....]

DESCRIPTION
    darwin-debug will exec itself into a child process <PROGRAM> that is
    halted for debugging. It does this by using posix_spawn() along with
    darwin specific posix_spawn flags that allows exec only (no fork), and
    stop at the program entry point. Any program arguments <PROGRAM-ARG> are
    passed on to the exec as the arguments for the new process. The current
    environment will be passed to the new process unless the "--no-env"
    option is used. A unix socket must be supplied using the
    --unix-socket=<SOCKET> option so the calling program can handshake with
    this process and get its process id.

EXAMPLE
   darwin-debug --arch=i386 -- /bin/ls -al /tmp
